Detective Pennelope Scout must solve a murder case in the mysterious, cult-like town of Timsville, run by a man named Tim. Uncover the town's secrets in this point-and-click murder mystery! 

This project was developed in 3 months with a team of 8 designers, for whom I was project manager.

I designed the UI and Narrative UX of the game. In collaboration with the programmer and narrative designers, I structured the Journal interface in a way that joins gameplay with story.

Asdirionally, I illustrated the game's backgrounds, and helped the rest of the art team develop a unified vision.
