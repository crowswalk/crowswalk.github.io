You're Georgie, the diplomat of the Rat clan! Your job: find out who violated the Rat-Pigeon-Squirrel Weekly Garbage Treaty. The Pigeons claim their rightful share of garbage was stolen! Find the true Garbage Thief in this **choice-driven Twine game**.

The idea for this game came from my love of city wildlife, especially chubby squirrels and pigeons. Our team of 4 writers designed a branch-and-bottleneck format for a single conversation between silly animal characters that we created together.

The writing process itself was collaborative, while I also took care of designing and implementing visuals and UI for the team over the course of 3 weeks.
