Hi! This is an overview of the year long Capstone Project I始m currently working on at NYU Game Center. 

Signal Creek is a Narrative RPG about three people trapped in a mall that shapes itself to reflect how they remember it. Explore each character's identity, develop their relationships, and resolve their past traumas in order to help them escape.

# Nour's Character Design
The Signal Creek team came up with our protagonists始 personalities and backstories as a group, drawing from our personal experiences.

I designed the appearance of Nour, using her backstory and considerations such as:
- how does Nour get ready for the day? 
- What does styling her hair mean to her? 
- What does she want to express with her clothing choices?

# Technical Narrative Design
We始re using Godot Engine (mono) which uses C# and GDScript 

For narrative systems, we始re using Ink by Inklestudios. 

As Technical Narrative Designer and programmer, I've bridged our ink scripts and Godot backend functionality, allowing all game writers to have control over the way the game works.

# Game Writing
As a team, we've emphasized a collaborative iteration process for the writing in Signal Creek. Everyone on the team has written first drafts of conversations, and passed them off to other team members for several iterations.

The biggest file that I structured is the Rina npc, which is a complex character that changes state throughout the course of the demo, and has the most dependencies in the game.
