The software developer Brent Watters disappeared a decade ago, leaving his twelve-year-old daughter Eloise without answers––apart from the name of his last project, Asphodel. 

Explore the mysteries of their family computer in Vanishing Point, a **puzzle-platformer** from COVE. Guide the virtual assistant Echo through platforming puzzles that **blend 2D and 3D space**. Together, Eloise and Echo may finally learn the secret behind Brent’s disappearance.

Vanishing point is created in Unity. As Technical Artist, I created a screen-space shader for the game's 3D space in ShaderLab. My goal was to evoke the nostalgia that Eloise experiences when exploring these old files. The shader has a subtle gradient map effect, blue noise dithering, and wiggly outlines that look hand-drawn. It also complements the memphis style particles I created throughout the 3D space.

I took inspiration from 90's pop art, the memphis design movement, and old OS design philosophies. Additionally, I had to work within design and technical constraints, restricting colors and lighting to allow for readable mechanics.
