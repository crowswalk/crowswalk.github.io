### Synopsis

The software developer Brent Watters disappeared a decade ago, leaving his twelve-year-old daughter Eloise without answers––apart from the name of his last project, Asphodel.

Explore the mysteries of their family computer in Vanishing Point, a **puzzle-platformer** from COVE. Guide the virtual assistant Echo through platforming puzzles that **blend 2D and 3D space**. Together, Eloise and Echo may finally learn the secret behind Brent’s disappearance.
