# Assorted Prototypes
![Prototypes Cover Image](images/prototypecover.png)

Assorted prototypes that don't (yet!) make the cut as standalone portfolio pieces. I still like them enough to put them here!

## Conjunctions

![Conjunctions Image](images/conjunctiongame.png)

A puzzle prototype I'm currently building as a way to gain more experience in React. Inspired by games like 2048, but replacing numbers with prefixes, word roots, and suffixes, with the goal of creating as many words as possible.

## Staniel

A two-hour game jam project for first-time Ren'Py users which follows the car-driving daydreams of a woefully unaware guy named Staniel.

## Robin

A quick prototype of a game menu interface made in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adapting text from Robin Hood. Made in 2021.

A text-only adaptation of a conversation from **Signal Creek** which features the Apple Prince.
