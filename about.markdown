Hello! My name is **Max**, but I go by **crowswalk** online. I'm a writer and narrative game developer based in **New York City**. I graduated from the **NYU Game Center** in May 2023 with a minor in **Web Programming and Applications**.

I'm also the co-creator of [snacktime games](http://snacktimegamestudio.com)!

I'm an experienced **Game Artist**, **Technical Narrative Designer/Writer**, and **Project Manager**.
As a programmer, I'm proficient in **Unity/C#**, **Godot**, and **GameMaker Studio 2**, as well as narrative frameworks like **Ink** and **YarnSpinner**.
 
Also, I'm a huge fan of bubble tea and all kinds of little creatures & guys!

If you're looking for a writer or artist, let's talk! You can reach me at **crowswalkwalk@gmail.com** or on LinkedIn.
