Hello! My name is **Max**, but I go by **crowswalk** online. I'm a narrative game developer based in **New York City**. I graduated from the **NYU Game Center** in May 2023 with a minor in **Web Programming and Applications**.

I'm also the co-creator of **[snacktime games](http://snacktimegamestudio.com)**!
