Hello! My name is **Max**, but I go by **crowswalk** online. I'm a narrative game developer, artist, writer, etc. based somewhere in the vast, abysmal expanse of **The United States**
I'm a co-creator of **[snacktime games](http://snacktimegamestudio.com)**!

Though I'm a bit elusive in the public domain and on the "internet dot com", I try to be warm in conversation. Maybe that's why I am a fan of crows.
